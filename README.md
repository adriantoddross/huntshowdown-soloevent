# I love Hunt: Showdown.

I play *a lot* of [Hunt: Showdown](https://www.huntshowdown.com/) and they recently finished up their first [solo event](https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/solo-event-leaderboard-and-extra-rewards). When viewing the leaderboard, I noticed that the table was an image and not actually coded into the webpage. This felt like a missed opportunity to me for a few reasons:

- None of the contestants social media accounts were (or could be) linked
- I couldn't sort by username, missions played, or figure out stuff like who made the most bounty with the fewest missions played
- I felt like the data could have been presented in a more interesting, nuanced way

After applying to [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/), I wanted to create a project based on [data visualization](https://www.elastic.co/blog/color-coded-visualizations-react). I expect to be finished up within a few days!
